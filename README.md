instavue: Fullstack Web2py -> Vue  app that serves as a dummy marketplace for photos

## Web2py, Vue, Sql, Stripe Oh My
Web2py, ever heard of it?  Honestly a really well documented robust framework that is very good for sharing app builds.  
Vue on the frontend, I was a big fan of their documentation.  The app allows users who are logged in to be able to add photos 
and set a price on them for other users to buy. The money concept was simply a means for practice using the Stripe API
